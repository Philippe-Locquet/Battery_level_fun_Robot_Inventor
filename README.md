# Battery_level_fun_Robot_Inventor
This is my take on a fun battery level program for the Mindstorms 51515 Robot Inventor

At the lowest level (under 10%) it displays the image of a plug.
The remaining battery states are displayed via bars (similar to cell network on phones).
Each battery state has a specific sound and Main button led color associated.

This program shows how I circumvented issues, I'm sure there is a way to rewrite this in more concise fashion, so feel free to contribute!

AKN:
Was useful to the creation of this program material posted online by:
Anton's Mindstorms hacks
Artpoz (on GitHub)
lego.github.io
And the help guides in the Mindstorms App
